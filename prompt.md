I am building a resume maker studio named Resumely. It is a power user interface for creating resumes with various templates.

The resume maker studio is a web application that allows users to create resumes using a variety of templates and export that resume into pdf.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for Resumely. I want it to be creative and unique. Really, push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have a directory initiallized with "create-next-app@latest" and bun, and fully functional application.

I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively

Use any skills you want
